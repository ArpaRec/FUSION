## Documentation
For source code setup, documentation, help with Marrow SDK integration, and more, check out [the wiki](https://github.com/Lakatrazz/BONELAB-Fusion/wiki).

## Networking
This mod is networked and built around Steam, but the networking system can be swapped out using a Networking Layer.

## Modules
Fusion supports a system called "Modules". This allows other code mods to add on and sync their own events in Fusion.
Fusion also has an SDK for integrating features into Marrowâ„¢ SDK items, maps, and more.

## Marrow SDK Integration
You can download the integration unity package from [the Releases tab of this repository](https://github.com/Lakatrazz/BONELAB-Fusion/releases/latest).
Alternatively, you can download the files raw [here](https://github.com/Lakatrazz/BONELAB-Fusion/tree/main/Core/marrow-integration).

## Distribution
Since this project falls under the MIT license, there is nothing preventing you from redistributing any version of the mod anywhere.
However, I would personally prefer and request that you do not reupload this mod to mod.io or thunderstore.io for the following reasons:

mod.io:
- mod.io is reserved for mods created using the official MarrowSDK, which Fusion is not. Thus, it will not function the same way as other mods on the site.

thunderstore.io:
- Fusion is already uploaded to thunderstore.io, so having a secondary upload only causes confusion.
- While the official thunderstore version may not be the same version as the latest source code, this is for a reason.
     - Development builds are unfinished and should not be uploaded to thunderstore. Uploading these to thunderstore only cause confusion and make people think that the mod is ready. If you would like for people to play development versions early, please redirect them to the github instead.

This also goes without saying but please do not redistribute Fusion in order to gain subscribers, server members, money, etc. It's just scummy.
Nothing stopping you, but please think twice before doing it.

## Disclaimer

#### THIS PROJECT IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY OTHER MULTIPLAYER MODS OR STRESS LEVEL ZERO! This is its own standalone mod and shares no code with others, any similarities are coincidental!
